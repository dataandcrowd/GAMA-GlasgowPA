# Geographic Boundary
## Description
* Scotland has its own names and theresholds for the Census boundaries.
* It is different from England and Wales.
* Output Areas (OAs) in Scotland are based on both population and household but Data Zone (DZ) and Intermediate Zone (IZ) are based on poulation only.
* In England, OAs, LSOAs, and MSOAs are all based on both population and household.

# Schools
Call files: primary schools and intermediate zones
```{r}
schools <- 
  read_sf("Glasgow/Bld_Schools_Glasgow.shp") %>% 
  select(DataZone, SAPE2014, Rank) %>% 
  mutate(FID = row_number()) 

iz <- read_sf("Glasgow/Glasgow_IZ.shp")
code <- read_csv("Glasgow/dz2011_codes_and_labels_21042020.csv")
```


Taking a glance on the data
```{r}
schools %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  glimpse()
```


Summary stats
```{r}
schools %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  get_summary_stats() %>% 
  print(n = Inf) 
```

Rank by IZs
```{r}
left_join(schools, code, by = "DataZone") %>% 
  select(FID, DataZone, IntZone, IntZoneName) %>% 
  rename(InterZone = IntZone) -> sch

sch %>% 
  group_by(InterZone, IntZoneName) %>% 
  summarise(no_of_schools = length(FID)) -> schools_area

schools_area$no_of_schools %>% sum

schools_area %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  arrange(desc(no_of_schools)) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```


Plot
```{r}
schools_area %>% st_drop_geometry() -> sch_df
  
iz %>% 
  left_join(sch_df, by = "InterZone") -> schools_choropleth

schools_choropleth %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = no_of_schools),
          show.legend = NA) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred", 
                        guide="colorbar",na.value="white") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") -> schools_plotly

ggplotly(schools_plotly)
